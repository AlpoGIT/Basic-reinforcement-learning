Some reinforcement learning algorithms:
- first visit MC on toy model
- Tile coding (still not sure about the code, just trying to get some results first). Best score -92 achieved in the MountainCar-v0 environment. After the training, the agent generally solves the problem in "3 moves": right, left, right. In Q-learning, the solution comes in 4 moves (generally, the car bounces against the left bound).
- Double Q-learning Vs Q-leaning in stochastic environment
