# First-Visit-MC
First-visit MC on toy model from "Reinforcement Learning with Replacing Eligibility Traces"(Sutton 96): two states Markov chain
On each step, the chain either stays in S = 0 with probability p = 0.75, or goes on to terminate in T = 1 with probability 1-p.
We wish to estimate the expected number of steps before termination when starting in S.
